<h1>Implied Valuation</h1>

<p>Founders working to raise equity funding from investors are eventually confronted with two key investor questions: 
    
<p style="text-align:center">How much do you need in this round?</p>

<p style="text-align:center">How much equity are you willing to give up for the investment?</p> 
    
    <p>The answer to these questions also answers a third key question on the investor’s mind—<b>what is your valuation?</b></p>

    <p><b>1. Talking about your raise amount and equity exchange is often expressed in the following manner:</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center">We are raising $150,000 for 15% of the company.</p>

    <p><b>2. Calculate the Implied Post-Money Valuation.</b> Divide the raise amount by the equity ownership percentage (expressed as a decimal), resulting in the post-money valuation, or how much you are saying your company is worth after the investor injects cash into the venture.</p>

    <p><b>3. Calculate the Pre-Money Valuation.</b> Subtract the raise amount from the post-money valuation, giving the pre-money valuation, or how much you are saying your company is worth before the investor injects cash into the venture.</p>
