<h1>Cap Table View of Valuation</h1>

<p>A capitalization table or cap table is a document (usually an Excel spreadsheet) that tracks who owns how much of a company. Founders maintain a cap table as they grow and raise money for the startup venture, frequently referencing the cap table to help answer questions such as: </p>

<li>How much equity does each founder own?</li> <li>How much money has been invested in the company over time?</li> <li>Who owns what type of shares—common shares, preferred shares?</li> <li>What are the valuation and share price at each funding stage?</li> <li>How many stock shares have been issued to stakeholders in the venture?</li>

<p>With this calculator view, you can explore various dilution scenarios based on the two key variables:</p><li>The pre-money valuation you negotiate with investors</li><li>The amount of money you raising this investment round</li><p>Enter the pre-money valuation, investment amount, and the equity ownership percentages of each founder (or existing stakeholder, such as a Friends & Family investor), and review how the investment scenario plays out.</p><p>As you can see, the higher your pre-money valuation, the less you get diluted.</p><p>Note that the investor percentage is calculated based on the raise amount and pre-money valuation.</p>
