<h1>Implied Valuation 1</h1>

<p><p>Startup fundraising often involves selling equity in your startup to an investor such as an angel group or venture capital firm, trading a percentage ownership of the startup corporation for investor cash.</p><p>Funding deals start by negotiating the investment amount and pre-money valuation with investors, resulting in their ownership percentage. Alternately, investors may request a certain equity ownership percentage for their money—33% for example.</p>
<p>In either approach, the valuation equation determines how much ownership the startup is exchanging for the cash investment.</p><p><b>1. Assign a value to the startup before the investment dollars are injected.</b> This value is called the pre-money valuation of the startup.</p><p><b>2. Add the investment amount to the pre- money valuation.</b> The result is called the post-money valuation.</p><p><b>3. Divide the investment amount by the post-money valuation to give the equity percentage owned by the investors.</b> This percentage is also called the founder’s dilution amount or percentage.</p>
