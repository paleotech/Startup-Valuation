<h1>Implied Dilution</h1>

<p>Equity investment discussions between startup founders and angel investors ultimately gravitate to two key questions: 

<p style="text-align:center">How much do you need in this round?, and</p>

<p style="text-align:center">How much are you willing to be diluted for the investment?</p>

<p>The answer to these questions also answers the question on the investor’s mind: How much do I get for my money?</p>

<p>This calculator screen reviews a common way to express these values to investors. </p> 
        <p><b>1. Talking about your raise amount and equity exchange is often expressed in the following manner:</b></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><b>We are raising $500,000 on a pre-money valuation of $1,000,000.</b></p>

    <p><b>2. Calculate the post-money valuation.</b> Simply add the raise amount to the stated pre-money valuation, resulting in the post-money valuation, or how much you are saying your company is worth after the investor puts cash into the venture. </p>

    <p><b>3. Calculate the implied dilution percentage.</b> Divide the raise amount by the post-money valuation, giving the founder dilution percentage, or how much equity founders are willing to give the investors in exchange for the cash injected into the startup venture. </p>
